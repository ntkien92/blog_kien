#### Mempool là gì?

The memory pool (Mempool) is a collection of unconfirmed transactions that await confirmation by all Bitcoin nodes. Think of it as a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions, and if the network is ever overloaded, the list can be quite long. Once it is confirmed, it is cemented into the blockchain and will remain there as long as the network is alive.
